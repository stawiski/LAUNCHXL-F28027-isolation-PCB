Measurement parameters

Vin = 3.308V
Vrec (voltage after rectifying diodes) = 3.866V
Vout = 3.292V (load current = 50mA)

plot1 - Vrec voltage, AC coupled, probing between GND near transformer and after both shottky diodes
plot2 - drain voltages of SN6501 chip showing the switching, DC coupled
plot3 - output voltages of the transformer, before shottky diodes, DC coupled
